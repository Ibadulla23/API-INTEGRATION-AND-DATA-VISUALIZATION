"API Integration and Data Visualization
API Integration and Data Visualization are fundamental aspects of modern web development, enabling applications to interact with external data sources and present that data in a meaningful, visual format.

API Integration
API (Application Programming Interface) integration involves connecting a web application with external services or data providers. APIs allow different software systems to communicate and exchange information in real time. Through RESTful APIs or GraphQL, developers can fetch data such as weather updates, financial statistics, user information, or third-party functionalities like payment gateways and maps.

In a typical frontend development scenario, API integration is implemented using HTTP requests via tools like fetch, Axios, or built-in browser APIs. The response, usually in JSON format, is then processed and displayed to the user. This approach reduces redundancy and allows developers to leverage powerful backend systems without building them from scratch".
